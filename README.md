# 🌐 LIVRE OS - Sovereign Identity Operating System  
**Verify anything. Reveal nothing. Own everything.**

LIVRE OS is the world’s first **identity-native operating system**, a modular, privacy-preserving foundation for digital identity, verification, and self-sovereign data control.

This repository contains the **public landing page** for the LIVRE OS project.

## 🚀 Overview

LIVRE OS replaces document-sharing and personal-data exposure with **cryptographic proofs**.

- No surveillance.  
- No sensitive data retention.  
- No centralized databases.  

Users keep everything inside **Solivre** — the sovereign identity kernel — and apps receive only verifiable **yes/no answers** using MPC/Garbled Circuits on the **COTI gcEVM**.

This repo showcases the concept and directs builders, auditors, and contributors to the project specifications.
